# Lab 1: Codebase tour

Before we get started, please run

```
cd lab2_soln/
pipenv run python text_recognizer/datasets/emnist_dataset.py
cd ..
```

## Goal of the lab

Familiarize you with the high-level organizational design of the codebase

## Follow along

```
cd lab9_soln/
```

## Project structure

Web backend

```
api/                        # Code for serving predictions as a REST API.
    tests/test_app.py           # Test that predictions are working
    Dockerfile                  # Specificies Docker image that runs the web server.
    __init__.py
    app.py                      # Flask web server that serves predictions.
    serverless.yml              # Specifies AWS Lambda deployment of the REST API.
```

Data (not under version control - one level up in the heirarchy)

```
data/                            # Training data lives here
    raw/
        emnist/metadata.toml     # Specifications for downloading data
```

Experimentation

```
    evaluation/                     # Scripts for evaluating model on eval set.
        evaluate_character_predictor.py

    notebooks/                  # For snapshots of initial exploration, before solidfying code as proper Python files.
